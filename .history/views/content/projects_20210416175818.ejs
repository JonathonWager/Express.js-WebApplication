<h1>Our Projects</h1>
<p>The following project focus was on developing our skills in object-orientated programming as we were developing a program that would create card objects that could be used for a wide variety of purposed including implementing into hundreds of different card games. The project was one of our favourites because it widned our skill set and showed us even further how useful object-orientate programming can be.</p>
<p>This next project was from our Systems and Automation class where we create a GPA calculator program that was able to handle input, and formatted output containing calculations for averages and more. This project was one of our other favourites because it worked perfectly and we learned a lot of things in the process of completing the project.</p>
